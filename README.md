# Optimizing HIV Treatment Strategies Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing and optimizing HIV treatment strategies using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and Q-Learning. The project involves preparing and cleaning the dataset, performing logistic regression analysis to classify patients based on treatment regimens, and applying Q-Learning to optimize treatment policies for reducing viral load.

## Project Overview

1. Data Preparation and Logistic Regression (data_cleaning.ipynb)

Purpose

	•	Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset by filtering and restructuring data relevant to the analysis.
	•	Feature Engineering: Calculate average biomarker values per patient.
	•	Classification: Assign patients to classes based on dominant treatment regimens.
	•	Logistic Regression: Use the prepared data to build a logistic regression model for predicting patient classes.
